## Core Onboarding Questions

Based on Financial Samurai's philosophy, the following questions will guide the initial AI onboarding:

1.  'What is your monthly expense budget, and how do you expect it to change in retirement?' (Focus on accuracy and inflation)
2.  'What is your target "FI Number"? (Calculated as 25x annual expenses per the Rule of 25)'
3.  'What are your passive income goals? (Dividends, real estate, etc.)'
4.  'What is your backup plan if markets underperform? (e.g., part-time work, lowering expenses)'
5.  'What will you "retire to"? (Identifying purpose beyond work)'
